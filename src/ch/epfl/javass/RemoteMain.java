 * Class that serves to launch a distant player. There are some important things

 * local main if you don't there will be an error. Also if you run it in another
 * computer you have to be connected to the same wifi as the host and you should
 * also give him your ip address that can be easily find by typing: whats my ip
 * adress? on an internet browser
